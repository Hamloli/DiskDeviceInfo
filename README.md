# Disk Device Utility for .NET

A comprehensive .NET library for identifying and categorizing disk drives and storage devices. This utility provides detailed information about physical, virtual, network, and removable storage devices in Windows systems.

## Notes
 - code was generated by us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0

## Features

- Detection of local, removable, network, and virtual drives
- Determination of mount types (physical, virtual, network)
- Detection of removable media with or without media present
- Comprehensive hardware information including:
  - Interface types and bus connections
  - Serial numbers and model information
  - Drive health status
  - Partition style (MBR/GPT)
- Output formatting for both console tables and CSV
- Support for filtering by device type and ready status

## Installation

### Package Manager Console

    PM> Install-Package DiskDeviceUtility

### .NET CLI

    dotnet add package DiskDeviceUtility

## Quick Start

    // Create an instance of the disk info utility
    DiskDeviceInfo diskInfo = new DiskDeviceInfo();
    
    // Get all disk devices
    List<DiskDevice> allDevices = diskInfo.GetDiskDevices();
    
    // Get only ready/mounted local drives
    List<DiskDevice> localDrives = diskInfo.GetDiskDevices(DeviceType.Local, true);
    
    // Print disk information to console
    diskInfo.PrintDiskDevices(allDevices);
    
    // Export to CSV
    diskInfo.PrintDiskDevices(allDevices, OutputFormat.CSV);

## Usage Examples

### Detecting All Drives Including Empty Media Slots

    // Get all disk devices including empty card readers or optical drives
    List<DiskDevice> allDevices = diskInfo.GetDiskDevices(onlyReady: false);
    
    // Check which removable devices have media
    foreach (DiskDevice device in allDevices.Where(d => d.DeviceType == DeviceType.Removable)) {
        Console.WriteLine($"{device.Model}: {(device.IsReady ? "Has Media" : "No Media")}");
    }

### Finding Network Drives

    // Get only network drives
    List<DiskDevice> networkDrives = diskInfo.GetDiskDevices(DeviceType.Network);
    
    foreach (DiskDevice drive in networkDrives) {
        Console.WriteLine($"{drive.DriveLetter} -> {drive.DeviceID}");
    }

### Examining Physical vs Virtual Drives

    List<DiskDevice> allDevices = diskInfo.GetDiskDevices();
    
    var physicalDrives = allDevices.Where(d => d.MountType == MountType.Physical);
    var virtualDrives = allDevices.Where(d => d.MountType == MountType.Virtual);
    
    Console.WriteLine($"Physical drives: {physicalDrives.Count()}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Virtual drives: {virtualDrives.Count()}");

## API Reference

### DiskDeviceInfo Class

The main class for retrieving disk device information.

#### Methods

- **GetDiskDevices(DeviceType? deviceTypeFilter = null, Boolean onlyReady = false)**  
  Returns a list of disk devices matching the specified filters.

- **PrintDiskDevices(List<DiskDevice> devices, OutputFormat format = OutputFormat.Table)**  
  Prints disk information to the console in the specified format.

### DiskDevice Class

Represents a single disk device with its properties.

#### Properties

- **DriveLetter**: Drive letter with colon (e.g., "C:")
- **VolumeName**: Volume label or name of the drive
- **DeviceType**: Type of storage device (Local, Removable, etc.)
- **MountType**: How the device is mounted (Physical, Network, Virtual)
- **IsReady**: Whether the drive has media and is ready for I/O operations
- **FileSystem**: File system format (NTFS, FAT32, exFAT, etc.)
- **TotalSize**: Total size of the drive in bytes
- **FreeSpace**: Available free space in bytes
- **DeviceID**: Windows device ID
- **Model**: Manufacturer and model information
- **SerialNumber**: Serial number of the device
- **InterfaceType**: Interface type (IDE, SATA, SCSI, USB, etc.)
- **MediaType**: Media type (Fixed hard disk, Removable media, etc.)
- **FirmwareRevision**: Firmware revision of the device
- **Manufacturer**: Device manufacturer name
- **PartitionStyle**: Partition style (MBR, GPT, etc.)
- **BytesPerSector**: Sector size in bytes
- **HealthStatus**: Health status of the device if available
- **VolumeGuid**: GUID of the volume
- **BusType**: Bus type (USB, SATA, NVMe, etc.)
- **LastAccessed**: Timestamp of when the drive was last accessed

### Enums

#### DeviceType
- **Unknown**: Unknown device type
- **Local**: Fixed local disk (internal HDD, SSD)
- **Removable**: Removable media (USB drives, memory cards)
- **Network**: Network mapped drive
- **CDRom**: Optical drive (CD, DVD, Blu-ray)
- **Ram**: RAM disk

#### MountType
- **Unknown**: Mount type could not be determined
- **Physical**: Physical device (directly connected via hardware interface)
- **Network**: Network mounted device
- **Virtual**: Virtual device (software-based)

#### OutputFormat
- **Table**: Formatted table output
- **CSV**: CSV format for data import

## Requirements

- .NET Framework 4.5+ or .NET Core 3.1+/NET 5.0+
- System.Management.dll (for enhanced Windows features)
